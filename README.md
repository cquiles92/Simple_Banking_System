This project is an example showing Java's connectivity with SQL using JDBC. The implementation of SQL is SQLite3. This project is a simple excercise in which a menu allows users to randomly generate a card, use Luhn's algorithm to validate the last digit (Checksum), and transfer funds between accounts. It saves and loads the changes with the SQL database provided by the user through the command line argument.
